# Recreational Drug Information

This web site is dedicated to giving people a guide to the effects of recreational drugs. It is not intended to encourage or dissuade individuals from taking drugs. The goal is to give an unbiased view on the effects of drugs on the human body. 

This project is largely influenced on my curiosity on my personal usage of drugs, especially caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, and anti-depressants).

The site will utilize the modern web's SVG capabilities to make an interactive experience for users. 

Core Design Elements:
- animations
    + Click drug -> animate colors on human figure divided into organs, brain sections and functions, and sensations.
    + Database or spreadsheet will store these variables for each drug
- infographics
    + D3.js will show graphs that indicate popular usage among genders, age groups, etc.
    + more to come
